        BlockingQueue is an interface in the java.util.concurrent package.
        It was introduced in Java 1.5.

        It is a thread-safe queue designed to support blocking operations.
        This makes it ideal for handling concurrent producer-consumer scenarios.

        Blocking behavior:
        - If the queue is FULL, a producer thread calling put() will block until space is available.
        - If the queue is EMPTY, a consumer thread calling take() will block until an element is available.

        How do we define if the queue is full or empty?
        - By specifying the queue's capacity at the time of creation (for bounded queues).

        BlockingQueue -- Interface
        Common Implementations:

        1. ArrayBlockingQueue
           - Bounded (fixed size).
           - Backed by an array.
           - Elements are ordered FIFO.

        2. LinkedBlockingQueue
           - Can be bounded or unbounded. capacity is Optional in constructor
           - Backed by linked nodes.
           - Typically used in Executor frameworks. -- next topic multithreading hi padhenge

        3. PriorityBlockingQueue
           - Unbounded.
           - Orders elements according to their natural ordering or a comparator.
           - Doesn't guarantee FIFO.

        4. DelayQueue
           - Unbounded.
           - Elements must implement the Delayed interface.
           - Elements can only be taken after a delay expires.

        5. SynchronousQueue
           - Has no capacity.
           - Each insert operation must wait for a corresponding remove operation.
           - Used for direct handoffs between threads.

        6. LinkedBlockingDeque
           - A double-ended queue variant of LinkedBlockingQueue.
           - Allows insertion/removal from both ends.
