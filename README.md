# 📚 CollectionsFramework

A curated collection of Java programs demonstrating the usage of the Java Collections Framework. This repository serves as a practical guide for understanding various collection classes and interfaces in Java.

---

## 🧰 Features

- Examples covering core collection interfaces: `List`, `Set`, `Map`, `Queue`, and `Deque`.
- Demonstrations of concrete implementations like `ArrayList`, `HashSet`, `HashMap`, `LinkedList`, and more.
- Illustrations of thread-safe collections such as `ConcurrentHashMap` and `CopyOnWriteArrayList`.
- Usage of utility classes from `Collections` and `Arrays`.
- Examples showcasing custom comparators and sorting mechanisms.
- Code snippets demonstrating fail-fast and fail-safe behaviors.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code

### Running the Examples

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kamya-creator/CollectionsFramework.git
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Navigate to the `src/org/example` directory.
4. Run the desired Java class containing the main method.

## 🧪 Examples Overview

- **ArrayListDemo.java**: Demonstrates basic operations on `ArrayList`.
- **HashMapDemo.java**: Illustrates key-value pair storage using `HashMap`.
- **ConcurrentHashMapDemo.java**: Shows thread-safe operations with `ConcurrentHashMap`.
- **FailFastAndFailSafe.java**: Explores the behavior of iterators in fail-fast and fail-safe scenarios.
- **ImmutableMapDemo.java**: Creates unmodifiable maps using `Collections.unmodifiableMap` and `Map.of`.
- **EnumMapDemo.java**: Utilizes `EnumMap` for efficient mapping with enum keys.
